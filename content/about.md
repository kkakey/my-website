### Hi! I'm Kristen. ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Scientist based in NYC, and I am passionate about using data and data science to help make a meaningful, positive impact on the public good.

I graduated with a masterâ€™s degree from Columbia University in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences and received my BA from Barnard College in Political Science.

Check out some of my personal projects and work on my [GitHub](https://github.com/kkakey).

And always feel free to [reach out](kka2120@columbia.edu)!

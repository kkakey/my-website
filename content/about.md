### Hi! I'm Kristen. 👋

I am an Analytics Engineer driven by a mission to use data for social good, especially in protecting and advancing voting rights. In my previous role as a Data Scientist at a political tech startup, I helped build and scale the company's data warehouse, developed internal tools and pipelines, and created dashboards and reports to support voter registration efforts. I graduated with a master’s degree from Columbia University in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences and received my BA from Barnard College in Political Science.

In my spare time, I enjoy practicing agility with my corgi, traveling, playing pickleball, and doing pottery.

Check out some of my personal projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/kkakey).

And always feel free to [reach out](kristen.k.akey@gmail.com)!

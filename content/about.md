### Hi! I'm Kristen. ðŸ‘‹

I am a recent graduate of the Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences program at Columbia University where I studied data science and applied statistics. 

I am passionate about using data and data science to help make a meaningful, positive impact on the public good.

Check out my latest projects and work on my [GitHub](https://github.com/kkakey/kkakey).
